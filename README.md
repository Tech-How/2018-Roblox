# 2018-Roblox
Bringing back the classic look and feel from 2018 Roblox.

The year of 2018 was when I played Roblox the most. Being hardly played anymore, I noticed the dull, gray cheez-it logo sitting at the bottom of my start menu. Somehow, somewhere, I got the idea of trying to make a skin to change the Roblox website back to that era. I hopped on the wayback machine and saw the classic login screen with the roller coster. Remember that? I marched my way over to the games page, and that classic blue header sent me a rush of nostalgia. I knew I had to follow through with it. About a week later, and here we are! I hope this theme brings back some memories for you as well, and as always, feel free to start an issue report or reach out if you have any ideas. :)
